### Problem Statement
We have a dataset of sales of different TV sets across different locations.<br>
Records look like:<br>
Samsung|Optima|14|Madhya Pradesh|132401|14200<br>
The fields are arranged like:<br>
Company Name|Product Name|Size in inches|State|Pin Code|Price<br>
There are some invalid records which contain 'NA' in either Company Name or Product Name.<br>
2. Write a Map Reduce program to calculate the total units sold for each Company.<br>
3. Write a Map Reduce program to calculate the total units sold in each state for Onida
company.
